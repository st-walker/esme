What was quantum efficiency before and after?

## TDS Calibration

1. [ ] Algorithm for moving from point to point.
2. [ ] Use the special bunch mid layer to do this stuff.
2. [ ] Save Points (centres of mass) of TDS calibration phase scan.
3. [ ] Algorithm for shifting to edges.
4. [ ] write the calibration to file at the end.


## HIREIS high resolution energy spread measurement

### High priority:

1. [ ] Get naive implementation based on assumed emittance and screen resolution
2. [ ] Full slice Measurements
3. [ ] Add dispersion measurement.
4. [X] Dynamically load the TDS calibration.
5. [X] make use of special bunch midlayer optional (but the default)
6. [X] add bunch length to the output
7. [X] Handle it gracefully on valueerror/domain error when input is shit.
8. [X] dso it with the special bunch midlayer so that we don't ahve to
   worry about shit going south, masks work etc. Because THE TDS IS
9. [X] change filenames to local time!  to match logbook...
10. [X] Save background images too beforehand please.
11. [X] Add background data to process.
12. [X] Add beta scan to gui.
13. [X] Button to interrupt/stop.
14. [X] get the results box working.


### Middle Priority

1. [ ] Add checklist to code.
2. [X] Handle case where measurement is started whilst config is open.
3. [X] copy configs to output as well for completion please.
4. [X] write comment box also to file in output directory.
5. [X] put directory location in text box
6. [X] Use a proper table for box vis.
7. [X] Add cycle ability to quadrupoles.
8. [X] write text box to output
9. [X] Just crash casually if beam goes off unexpectedly.
10. [X] Need to control TDS from the panel
11. [X] Button to open the camera server (CHECK!)
12. [ ] get buttons working for dispersion/beta selection.



### Low Priority

1. [ ] "Repeat TDS Scan" button (no need always to do e.g. dispersion scan or whatever...)
2. [ ] get beta/dispersion selection correct.
3. [ ] Full suite of data plots.
4. [X] make sure the config panel works.
5. [X] Add label to dispersion setting label.


## LPS Main GUI


### High Priortiy

1. [ ] Find phase.
2. [ ] Reconstruct current profile using both crossings.
3. [ ] Subtract background button.
4. [X] Get transverse projections working.
5. [X] Get time projection working.
6. [X] Get energy projection working.


I need to be able to distinguish between rising and falling zero intercepts.

### Middle Priority

1. [ ] Get plain data taking working.
2. [ ] bunch pattern to and from I1D or B2D.
3. [ ] Design kick server, tto and from 200m optics, to and from I1D.
4. [ ] Automatically Calibrate TDS.
5. [X] Get negative axis working.


### Low Priority

1. [ ] Get indiciators working.
2. [ ] Dispersion measurement.
3. [ ] Steering with kickers onto the screen.
