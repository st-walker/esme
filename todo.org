What was quantum efficiency before and after?

## TDS Calibration

1. [ ] Algorithm for moving from point to point.
2. [ ] Use the special bunch mid layer to do this stuff.
2. [ ] Save Points (centres of mass) of TDS calibration phase scan.
3. [ ] Algorithm for shifting to edges.
4. [ ] write the calibration to file at the end.


## HIREIS high resolution energy spread measurement

### High priority:

1. [ ] Get naive implementation based on assumed emittance and screen resolution
2. [ ] Add timestmap to output.
3. [ ] Full slice Measurements
4. [ ] Add dispersion measurement.
5. [ ] Add Laser Heater Status
6. [ ] Fix bug with TDS tickbox going out of date in SBM panel.
7. [ ] Refuse the loading of projected match .mat file.
8. [ ] Add Beam on/off buttons, add TDS on/off buttons.
9. [X] Dynamically load the TDS calibration.
10. [X] make use of special bunch midlayer optional (but the default)
11. [X] add bunch length to the output
12. [X] Handle it gracefully on valueerror/domain error when input is shit.
13. [X] dso it with the special bunch midlayer so that we don't ahve to
    worry about shit going south, masks work etc. Because THE TDS IS
14. [X] change filenames to local time!  to match logbook...
15. [X] Save background images too beforehand please.
16. [X] Add background data to process.
17. [X] Add beta scan to gui.
18. [X] Button to interrupt/stop.
19. [X] get the results box working.
20. [ ] Open output directory button
21. [ ] LH indicator
22. [ ] also write which version of esme is being used and where?e
23. [ ] copy over scan.yaml as well also writing the calibration to the scan.yaml file.



### Middle Priority

1. [ ] Add checklist to code.
2. [ ] If measurement successfully ran through to the end, then write a "file successful" thing too...  or write link to logbook entry!
3. [X] Handle case where measurement is started whilst config is open.
4. [X] copy configs to output as well for completion please.
5. [X] write comment box also to file in output directory.
6. [X] put directory location in text box
7. [X] Use a proper table for box vis.
8. [X] Add cycle ability to quadrupoles.
9. [X] write text box to output
10. [X] Just crash casually if beam goes off unexpectedly.
11. [X] Need to control TDS from the panel
12. [X] Button to open the camera server (CHECK!)
13. [ ] get buttons working for dispersion/beta selection.



### Low Priority

1. [ ] "Repeat TDS Scan" button (no need always to do e.g. dispersion scan or whatever...)
2. [ ] get beta/dispersion selection correct.
3. [ ] Full suite of data plots.
4. [X] make sure the config panel works.
5. [X] Add label to dispersion setting label.


## LPS Main GUI


### High Priortiy

1. [ ] Find phase.
2. [ ] Reconstruct current profile using both crossings.
3. [ ] Subtract background button.
4. [X] Get transverse projections working.
5. [X] Get time projection working.
6. [X] Get energy projection working.


I need to be able to distinguish between rising and falling zero intercepts.

### Middle Priority

1. [ ] Get plain data taking working.
2. [ ] bunch pattern to and from I1D or B2D.
3. [ ] Design kick server, tto and from 200m optics, to and from I1D.
4. [ ] Automatically Calibrate TDS.
5. [X] Get negative axis working.


### Low Priority

1. [ ] Get indiciators working.
2. [ ] Dispersion measurement.
3. [ ] Steering with kickers onto the screen.


* Data Explorer

** High Priority

- [ ] Change the TDS Calibration.
- [ ] Get image analysis actually working.
- [X] Jump to result.
- [ ] Mask images.
- [ ] Show slice energy spread.
- [ ] Add outlier filtering


** Medium Priority


- [ ] R34 plot.
- [ ] Plot TDS voltages
- [ ] Plot streaking parameters
- [ ] plot apparent bunch lengths
- [ ] plot actual bunch lengths
- [ ] plot fits.
- [X] Highlight line when I click on it
- [ ] Change number of slices (slider).
- [ ] Change slice algorithm (position versus max energy based).
- [ ] Mask Setpoints.
- [ ] Also show background images.
- [ ] Close children when parent is closed.

** Low Priority

- [ ] Highlight in image ana breakdown when i click row.
- [ ] Use multiprocessing or multithreading.
- [ ] Save plot, save plot data...
- [ ] should TDS scan be linear or not?
- [ ] Maintain image processing stage across different image viewings.
- [ ] Show in window what the "current" slice energy spread is at each stage.
- [ ] Force cropping when image analysis is on.  otherwise it makes no sense anyway!
