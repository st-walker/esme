# Priority:

# Take data automatically.
# Should be able to turn TDS on/off
# Should be able to recover from TDS turning off randomly.
# Should keep track of good images/bad images.  Ignore bad ones.
# Should also write metadata nicely.
# Should automatically change voltage for TDS scan.
# Should automatically change quads for dispersion scan.
# Turn beam on and off
# Should check TDS is on, check beam is on, check screen is out.
# Autogain?


# this is a hobby, let's be honest..  let's go home and use our brain
# on something harder and do this in the evenings.

# Then do, say, measure dispersion automatically
# Finally, say, calibrate the TDS automatically
