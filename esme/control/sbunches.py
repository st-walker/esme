"""Module for controlling the Special Bunch Midlayer (SBM) for diagnostic bunches

It is responsible for firing diagnostic bunches and optionally firing
kickers and the TDS in tandem with these diagnostic bunches.

This module is designed to be an easy way to set the SBM for the desired use:

1. Select a beam region and bunch number to be kicked, streaked, both or neither.
2. Select a kicker or kickers to fire (or not, if e.g. for an on-axis screen).
3. Select whether to use the TDS in that area (or not if you don't want the beam streaked).

Screens
-------

The SBM is generally screen-agnostic and doesn't know much about
screens (although there is some duplication here---see
`SpecialBunchControl.is_screen_ok`).  It assumes that the kicker
voltages and timings are configured correctly if you have a specific
screen in mind.

If the fast kickers ARE used then the screen should be OFF-axis.  
If the fast kickers ARE NOT used then the screen should be ON-axis.

Control list
------------

Most addresses are somewhat self explanatory, but the control list should be explained.
In principle you do not need to know about this as the class below takes care of it,
however for posterity I include it here to save you the effort I myself made.

The addresses for I1 and B2, respectively, are:

XFEL.SDIAG/SPECIAL_BUNCHES.ML/I1/CONTROL
XFEL.SDIAG/SPECIAL_BUNCHES.ML/B2/CONTROL

Each is a 4-tuple of integers.  Each entry of this tuple has a different meaning. In order:

0. The bunch number of the diagnostic bunch of the given subtrain.
   The kickers and TDS will (if desired) be fired for this bunch.
   It can be at most n+1, where n is the number of bunches in the
   selected subtrain.  If equal to n+1, then a bunch is appended
   to the bunch train, if greater than n+1, then when the diagnostic
   bunch is activated, nothing will happen.
1. Whether to use the TDS for the diagnostic bunch.
   0 = don't use, 1 = use.
2. The ID of the kicker number we will fire for the diagnostic bunch.
   At the time of writing, an integer between 1 and 4.
3. Doesn't do anything.


Kicker Activation
-----------------

One tricky detail is how we choose whether or not to use the kickers when using the SBM.
The JDDD panels (Beam Dynamics -> Expert Panels -> Diag Bunches Inj / Diach Bunches BC2)
have the checkbox "KAX on/off" (for I1: XFEL.SDIAG/SPECIAL_BUNCHES.ML/54.I1/KICKER.ON)
for determining whether or not the kickers should be _powered_.  But that does not mean
the kickers will necessarily be used, the "kicker number" (also found on the above JDDD panels)
of the control 4-tupleÂ (e.g. for I1, address = XFEL.SDIAG/SPECIAL_BUNCHES.ML/I1/CONTROL)
must also be set to a kicker number for which there exists a corresponding kicker with that number
assigned to it in DOOCS.  Using I1 as an example, the kicker numbers of the two kickers in I1
can be read using the pydoocs read (or by using
SpecialBunchesControl.get_kicker_name_to_kicker_number_map below):

```
pydoocs.read("XFEL.SDIAG/SPECIAL_BUNCHES.ML/K*.I1/KICKER_NUMBER")
```

where (at the time of writing) the kicker numbers of KAX.54.I1 and KAX.56.I1
can be seen to be 1 and 3, respectively.  There are no other diagnostic kickers in I1.

Therefore if we set the kicker number in the control address
(or by using SpecialBunchesControl.set_kicker_name below) to 1, then KAX.54.I1 will be fired
with the SBM.  If 3, then KAX.56.I1, but if 2 then no kicker will be fired.  In short: this means
that to disable the kickers, the kickers must be powered off OR the kicker number
of the I1 control list in this case must be set to any number except 1 and 3.  Conversely, if the kickers
are on, then the kicker number must be set to 1 or 3.  

In general, we prefer to leave the kickers on as powering them on/off takes times, so controlling
kicker activation is done by changing this kicker number to and from a small set of integers (at the time
of writing: 1 or 3 for I1 and 1, 2, 3 or 4 in B2).

I1 or B2
--------

The SBM is specific to the two diagnostic regions as well, either in
I1 or B2.  It is meaningless to mix these two, e.g. firing the TDS in
the injector alongside kickers in B2.  Whether or not a given class instance is 
responsible for I1 or B2 is defined in the __init__.
