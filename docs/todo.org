What I have learned:

I hate GUI development.  It is boring.

Finish the Python XFEL model for good.

Then move to C++/theory/ML exclusively and stick existing codes in maintenance mode.

Fundamentally TDS is two problems:

- Ramp to arbitrary amplitudes whilst keeping image centred on screen.
- Find edges.





Comments on pitz talk:

time jitter is a problem for tds scan, 50 pixel shift over tds scan...
need care for where the central slice is defined..


what about longer term drifts in the tds scan?

jitter increases spot size due to tds wehn using many images.


does specific zero crossing matter?  at max iv it does apparently?


comments on ibs talk by thomas lucas



Comments on my talk:

1. Consider impact of pixel noise, etc, and really understand the simulation process.
2. Do different zero crossings matter?
3. Is the maximum energy slice really the minimum slice energy spread?
   Could point to beam tilt incoming.
4. do we have closed dispersion at different bunch charges??
5. impact of the cubic term on the shorter bunches?
6. what about measuring the central slice as opposed to the peak energy slice to match Erion?


training Inputs: A1 voltage, TDS amplitude and phase, ?

training: how the screen image responds, but it has to be very quick..

user inputs: move beam to edge of screen, move it to the centre..  centre beam...

pretrained TDS-ness, OK amplitude is zero then we know changing
voltage will do nothing...  should always start at zero amplitude if it's smart.

"down", "down a bit", "to edge of screen", "to bottom edge of screen", "half way to bottom"

"Go up to 10% and keep in middle"

"find zero crossing"

e.g. HV is looking weird or whatever..  but it streaks!

im training it to characterise the TDS.

extract somehow the tds resolution.  1 mm on screen = how many fs?


they did -0.25 to +0.25 degrees.


motivation: well phase is constantly changing, random drifts in
machine, we are solving with software, hardware costs millions!

I should consider though, what about just using an anlystic model?

what about simulations: some random phase, some random (unknown)
voltage, can i extract the true value quickly?  first extract the
phase and then the voltage.

finding the phase consists of:

1. Take with TDS completely off.
2. Turn TDS on, find phis that is closest to 1
3. add 180 to get the other one.

4. can we leverage knowledge of r34s at other points?  I think not maybe...

5. can we simply sample a small number of points and boom, done?
   adjacent, or not adjacent, or...?
