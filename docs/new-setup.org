1. [ ] Turn off write protection on main dump dipole                                                                               
2. [ ] Dump switch :: Operations/Procedures -> Operation -> Dump Switch
3. [ ] Main Timing :: Injector -> Main Timing -> Bunch Pattern Server etc..
4. [ ] Turn INJ feedback off:: Operations & Procedures -> SASE1 Tuning -> INJ off
5. [ ] RF sum voltage control, etc.
6. [ ] Set scalar mode
7. [ ] A1 and AH1 to 0.0
8. [ ] Take AH1 off beam.
9. [ ] Go to 130MeV in I1D.
10. [ ] Turn off LH
11. [ ] Magnet energizer server
12. [ ] Cycle magnets :: Magnets -> Magnets -> Overview
13. [ ] Find A1 phase :: RF -> Scan Tools -> INtelliPhase -> A1 with LH.  Does not need to be in scalar mode.
14. [ ] Find AH1 phase :: RF -> Scan Tools -> INtelliPhase -> AH1 with LH.  Does not need to be in scalar mode.
15. [ ] Go to 100pC :: Injector -> Injector Laser NEPAL -> right click
    -> layers-> Show attenuator -> move slider to right to decrease
    charge
16. [ ] Gun Phase :: Injector -> RF Gun Tools -> Gun Phase Scan.
17. [ ] go back to 250pC
18. [ ] Calibrate the TDS

Open Output Directory button.                  
insert real dispersions.
Get calibration working properly...  has to be done for next time please...
Clear Beta plot properly plz.

Get data directly from the plot?  Could be cleaner...

pause when no beam.  even though yes we use SBML

button to just take data, don't bother with visualiation

please turn off sbml at end properly!!sruss
